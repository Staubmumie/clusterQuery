# Cluster Queries

This project focuses on clustering a set of queries over event streams. Three different vectorization approaches are implemented, followed by clustering using the K-Means algorithm:

1. **Structural Distance**  
   Based on a hierarchical structure that measures the distance between queries.

2. **Syntactic Similarity**  
   Inspired by Information Retrieval techniques, clustering is performed based on the syntactic form of the queries.

3. **Semantic Similarity**  
   Uses an extended version of the Word2Vec model to represent the semantic meaning of the queries.

For a detailed explanation of the methodology, implementation, and evaluation, please refer to the included PDF:
